# 🇯🇵 japan-101-for-foreigners

A survival guide for living in Japan as a foreigner, written from real experience, not government pamphlets.

This repo covers the essential things I wish someone had told me earlier, such as how to get your Zairyū Card, deal with paperwork, find a job, navigate daily life, and more.  
Whether you're here on a J-Find visa, a student visa, or just figuring things out, I hope this helps you feel a little more at home in Japan <3

## 🤝 Contributing

This guide is built from my own experience (J-Find visa).  
If you’ve lived in Japan and want to add your own tips, feel free to fork and make a PR, or just open an issue to suggest something!


## 🙋 Why I Made This

Because Japan doesn't come with a manual ：） but it should.  
And because Googling “how to register at 区役所” in English at 2am is ✨not fun✨.
