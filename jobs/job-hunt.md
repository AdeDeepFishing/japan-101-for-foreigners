# 💼 Job Hunting in Japan

There are generally two main paths for job hunting in Japan:  
1. **Student (新卒 / shinsotsu)** route  
2. **Society (中途 / mid-career)** route

I personally took the **society route**, so I’ll spend more time on that.  
But I’ll briefly go over the student route first.


## 🎓 1. Student Route (新卒)

If you're still in school or recently graduated *with strong Japanese skills*, this route is built for you.

### ✅ What to know:
- The new grad hiring season starts around **April**, but **you need to start preparing 1–2 years in advance**
- Companies don’t expect you to have real work experience, they actually *train you from scratch*
- Even students from 文科 (liberal arts) majors can end up in engineering roles — **anything is possible**

I really admire this system 🤌. Compared to countries where even “entry-level” roles ask for 3–5 years of experience (iykyk😅), Japan is way more beginner-friendly for students who prepare early and can speak Japanese ♥️


## 🧑‍💼 2. Society Route (中途 Mid-career or Non-Japanese-speaking New Grad)

This is the path I took:  
- I had **limited experience** (only internships, which doesn't really count in most cases)  
- And **zero Japanese fluency (😭 I'm actively learning right now...)**  
So I was kind of a “new grad”, but I couldn’t take the official student route, and that made job hunting harder for me.

But **it’s still 100% possible.** Here's how I made it through.


## 💡 Strategy: What Helped Me

### 🔍 Apply Everywhere, Every Day

- Platforms I used:
  - ✅ **LinkedIn** ← I got my current job through this!
  - Indeed
  - Wantedly
  - Findy
- Use **LinkedIn filters** and search tricks to find jobs posted in the last **1 hour**  
  → Apply immediately to be one of the first candidates
  → Also connect to the hr on LinkedIn
- **Document your journey**! I used a Google Sheet to track:
  - Company, job title, JD, application date
  - Interview status, HR contacts, notes
  - Even a simple one would work well: ![Screenshot 2025-06-25 at 11 30 04 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e14b4d88-d028-4a7c-9d13-be2d78995c82)

  Once you get to interviews, this helps *a lot* for prep.


### 💬 Connect & Network

- Message recruiters after applying, *don't be shy*
- Tons of people are applying, so connecting and saying something will def stand out a lot
- Ask about the role, express interest, and request interviews
- Go to tech events, networking meetups, and hiring expos:
  - Use **Meetup.com**, **Lu.ma**, or Discord groups
- I got **several interviews just by talking to people at events**, people in Tokyo are really open and willing to refer 🫶

### 🧘‍♀️ Mindset: Stay In the Game

- I applied to **575 jobs** over **2 months**
- I got my offer from the **265th application**
- So trust me when I say: **you never know which one will work**

The hardest part is **mentally staying confident**:
- Keep telling yourself: *“I’ll get a job. I'll make it. I’ll be fine.”*
- Even if you fail an interview? That’s okay. It’s **just practic, and u gonna get better every time.**
- There are **so many companies & opportunities** out there. Keep going.

This is real life Law of Attraction:  
Say it, believe it, act like it, and it’ll eventually come true ✨✨✨

Don't underestimate how powerful it is to:
