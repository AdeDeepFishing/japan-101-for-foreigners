# 🏥 Health Insurance in Japan

Welcome to the land of **universal healthcare**, but yes, you’ll have to sign up and probably pay a monthly fee. Here's how it works.


## 🇯🇵 Two Main Types

1. **National Health Insurance (国民健康保険 / Kokumin Kenkō Hoken)**  
   For freelancers, students, and job seekers (aka most J-Find holders).

2. **Employee Health Insurance (社会保険 / Shakai Hoken)**  
   If you get a full-time job with benefits, you’ll be enrolled through your employer.

If you're on a J-Find visa, you’ll most likely be under **National Health Insurance** until you get hired full-time.


## 📝 How to Apply

After registering your address at the **ward office (区役所)**, they’ll guide you to the health insurance desk (usually the same floor as the nenkin).

Bring:
- Your Zairyū Card
- Your residence registration

You’ll receive:
- A **health insurance card (保険証)** in the mail later, sometimes they give you in person on the exact same day. It depends on which ward office you go to
- Monthly payment slips (unless you set up auto-withdrawal)


## 💰 How Much Does It Cost?

The exact number depends on where you are. For example, I just had my bills: I suppose to pay 6400 yen for June, and 5500 yen for July.

If you **had income in the previous year (even overseas)** or stay a while, the rate can go up.


## 🧾 What Does It Cover?

- Around **70% of your medical costs** are covered
- You pay the remaining 30% out of pocket
- Includes: doctor visits, dentist, hospital care, prescriptions

This also means if you randomly get sick or need to see a specialist, you’re not totally screwed.
If I using this one day (which means I got sick), will update this file to share my experience 🙃

## 🧠 Tips

- Carry your **insurance card** to all medical visits
- Even without fluency, most clinics are used to foreigners and will help, with a translator and enough patience, you will be fine :)
- If you move to a new city/ward, update your info at the new 区役所



## TL;DR

- 🏃 Apply at 区役所 after address registration
- 💸 Expect to pay ~¥5,000–¥7,000/month if unemployed
- 🏥 Covers 70% of medical fees, def *use it!*
