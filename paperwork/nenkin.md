# 💸 Nenkin – Japanese Pension System

Yes, even if you're not planning to retire in Japan, you still get dragged into the **pension system**. It’s called **国民年金 (kokumin nenkin)** or just “Nenkin.”


## 🪪 What Is Nenkin?

Japan has a **national pension system**, and *everyone* living here long-term is required to join, including foreigners.

It’s mainly for retirement, but also includes disability and survivor benefits. However, if you're just here for a short time or don’t plan to retire in Japan, there's a **refund system** later.


## 🧍 Who Has to Pay?

If you're on a **J-Find visa** (or any visa over 3 months), you’re considered a resident and are legally required to:

- Enroll in the **National Pension** if you’re self-supporting or unemployed
- Or be part of **Employee Pension (厚生年金)** if you get hired full-time

J-Find folks usually fall into the **National Pension** group.


## 📍 Where to Apply

Go to your **ward office (区役所)** after registering your address. They’ll handle:
- Health insurance
- Pension enrollment
- Optional exemption application

Highly recommend doing this activity on the same day while registering your address, it would save you tons of time.


## ✨ Exemption == Your Bestie

If you have **low or no income**, you can apply for a **exemption**. (Imagine having no income but still have to pay, I couldn't 💀)
This is super common for J-Find visa holders, and YES, **you can apply right after arrival.** Personally I waived for three months, and I got a friend who has waived for a whole year. The waiving system works well, so no worries.

Bring:
- Your Passport
- Your Zairyū Card
- Residence registration
- Income info (if you have any or explain that you just arrived and aren’t earning yet)

If approved, you **don’t need to pay nenkin** for now, and you can still stay legal.


## 💰 If You Do Pay: Refund Later

If you **do** end up paying into the system and leave Japan later, you can apply for a **lump-sum withdrawal (脱退一時金)**, a partial refund of what you paid.

But you’ll have to file for it *within 2 years of leaving Japan*, and the process is kind of annoying.

## TL;DR

- 🏛️ Enroll at 区役所 when you move in
- 🙋‍♀️ Ask for an **exemption** if you’re unemployed or job-hunting
- 🧾 If you do pay, **you can get some money back later**
