# 🛂 Visa Basics (Focused on J-Find Visa)

## What is a J-Find Visa?

The **J-Find visa** (未来創造人材制度) is a special visa that allows *recent graduates from top universities* to stay in Japan for **up to 2 years** to job-hunt, start a business, or explore life in Japan.

Unlike a work visa, you don’t need a job offer before coming. It’s designed to give you time and freedom to “figure it out.” (It was published from 2023 April, which is still super new, prepare to explain it a lot during job hunting.)


## ✅ Eligibility Requirements

You need to meet **ALL THREE** conditions below:

1. Graduated from a university ranked in the **Top 100** in either:
   - **QS World University Rankings**
   - **THE (Times Higher Education) Rankings**
   - **Shanghai Ranking**
   (The website also provide the list of all the eligible schools: https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001394994.pdf)
2. Graduation must be **within the past 5 years**
3. Proof of **at least 200,000 JPY** in savings, which is around 1371.16 dollars right now


## 📋 Application Process

1. **Prepare Documents:**
   - Diploma
   - Proof of funds (bank statement with 200,000 JPY+)
   - Resume (can be English or Japanese)
   - Visa application form (在留資格認定証明書交付申請書)
   - Passport & ID photo (30x40mm, white background)

2. **Submit Application**  
   - Submit the above to your nearest **Japanese Immigration Bureau (入管局)** in your country  
   - Or through a proxy

3. **Get Your COE & Visa**  
   - Once approved, you’ll receive a **Certificate of Eligibility (COE)**. (I didn't get mine, and it didn't hurt either.) 
   - Then you can apply for the visa at your nearest Japanese consulate/embassy


## 📦 What to Bring When Applying

- Passport (valid for at least 6 months)
- 30x40mm photo (white background)
- Visa application form & info sheet
- Photocopies of ID and household registration (if required in your country)
- University diploma
- Bank statement
- Resume + life/career plan (can use a template)

## ⌛️ Wait for the visa

- Normally it would take around 1 week to three months to get the result, so all you need is patience. 
- Once getting the visa, you need to enter Japan within three months, or the visa would be expired. 


## 🛬 After Arrival

Once you land in Japan:
- You’ll receive your **Zairyū Card** at the airport
- You must **register your address at the local 区役所 within 14 days**
- You can start looking for jobs, attending meetups, launching your own thing, or just enjoy your gap year(s)



## ❗Other Visa Types (Brief Mention)

Here are some other common visas foreigners use to stay in Japan:

| Type          | Notes |
