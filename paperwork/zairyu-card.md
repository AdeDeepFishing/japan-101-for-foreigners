# 在留カード (Zairyū Card) – Your Japanese Resident Card

If you're living in Japan mid- to long-term (e.g. J-Find, work visa, student visa), the **Zairyū Card** is your official ID — and you *need it for everything.*

This guide is based on my personal experience entering Japan on a **J-Find Visa**, so some parts may differ slightly for other visa types.

## ✈️ Getting Your Zairyū Card at the Airport

When you land in Japan, immigration officers will:
1. **Check your visa status**
2. **Issue your Zairyū Card on the spot** (it takes just a few minutes)

They’ll also stamp your passport with a residence status and a “residence card issued” note.  
Congrats — this is now your most important card in Japan. 🪪


## 🏠 Registering Your Address (within 14 days!)

Within **14 days** of arriving in Japan, you must go to your **local ward office (区役所)** to register your address.

### What if you don’t have a home yet?
- Use your friend’s address **(with their permission)**
- No friends? You *can* technically use a temporary address, but do it at your own risk (some people pay others for this, which is shady but happens 🤫)

⚠️ Be sure to go to the **correct 区役所 for your address**, not just the closest one.


## 🧾 What Happens at the Ward Office?

At the 区役所:
- Head to the **1st floor** or general counter area
- Ask for the **住民登録 (jūmin tōroku) / address registration** form
- Most offices offer **English forms** or instructions
- You don’t need fluent Japanese — Google Translate + patience = you’re good

You can also apply for:
- [Health Insurance](./health-insurance.md)
- [Pension (Nenkin)](./nenkin.md)  
These can often be done on the same visit, probably in the second or third floor.



## 👮 Carrying Your Card (Yes, Always)

By law, **you’re required to carry your Zairyū Card at all times**.

Police officers *can* stop you and ask for it. It doesn’t happen often, but it’s not a myth.  
To be safe, just keep it in your wallet like your ID.



## ✅ TL;DR Summary

- 🛬 Card is issued at airport
- 🕒 Register your address at 区役所 within 14 days
- 🏠 Make sure you go to the *correct* ward office
- 📝 You can handle health insurance & pension there too
- 🧍 Always carry your card when outside
